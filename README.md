# Tadhack_2016
Hack made during the weekend

This repository contains the webpage for the app developed by me with my team mates during the TADHack.
Our company's name is "I'm here"

# Winner of the Cisco Hackathon - 2016


# Idea is to create the App where you can make a group of prople who are close by. You can mark your radius too. You can also make your group Public / Private as well. You can send out the invite, you can share your ideas and content with the people who are near to you.
